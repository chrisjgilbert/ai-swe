To create a static "Hello, World" page at the root path of a Ruby application, we will need to consider a few common scenarios depending on the web framework being used. Assuming we are using Ruby on Rails, here is how we can implement this:

### Step 1: Generate a new Rails Application (if not available)

If you haven't created a Rails application yet, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
rails new hello_world_app
cd hello_world_app
```

### Step 2: Create a Static Controller

Generate a controller that will serve our "Hello, World" page using the Rails generator:

```bash
rails generate controller Pages index
```

### Step 3: Update Routes

Next, we need to set the root route to point to the `index` action of the `Pages` controller. Open the `config/routes.rb` file and update it as follows:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'pages#index'
end
```

### Step 4: Update the Controller

Edit the newly created controller located at `app/controllers/pages_controller.rb` to implement any logic if needed, though for a static page, you might not need any extra action aside from rendering:

```ruby
class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    # No additional logic needed for the static page
  end
end
```

### Step 5: Create the View

Next, we need to create a view that will display "Hello, World". Edit the view file at `app/views/pages/index.html.erb`:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello World</title>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my static page!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 6: Start the Rails Server

Now, to see the changes, start the Rails server:

```bash
rails server
```

After starting the server, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the "Hello, World" message rendered on the page.

### Final Considerations

- Ensure that you have the required gems installed by running `bundle install`.
- You might want to consider adding styles or more HTML as needed to further enhance the look of your static page.
- If your application is going to be hosted, ensure that it follows best practices for deployment.

### Summary

The steps above demonstrate how to create a simple static "Hello, World" page in a Ruby on Rails application. This implementation is clean, easily maintainable, and leverages Rails conventions effectively. If the project were using a different Ruby web framework (like Sinatra), the implementation would slightly differ. However, with Rails being a common choice, this solution fits typical use cases.
